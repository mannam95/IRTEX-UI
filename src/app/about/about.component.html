        We present X-Vision, an explainable AI (XAI) driven image retrieval system based on a re-ranking approach to support non-expert users. We generate textual explanations such as, ''This image is similar to query image in color by Y%, shape by Z%'' along with visual explanations that compare image features. Besides the XAI goal of making AI systems transparent, we address the semantic gap between user's perception and model ranking, which arises in content based image retrieval (CBIR). We attempt to explain the notion of similarity in images in a query-by-example scenario, starting with relatively simple features such as color, texture, objects, background-foreground segments, moving to semantic representations learned from hidden layers of deep networks. The base retrieval model compares the query vector with other image feature vectors to create rankings. This result list is transferred to a semantic feature space that allows rule-based re-rankings. The core contribution of this work is a re-ranking algorithm for generating explanations. Our re-ranking improves retrieval performance (MAP) when compared with a base ranker, a random baseline, and recent CBIR baseline rankers on PASCAL VOC data. We evaluate XAI focused aspects of user trust in an eye-tracker based user study, we find that explanations supported users in the search process and understanding the notion of similarity.
